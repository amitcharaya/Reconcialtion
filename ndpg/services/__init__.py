"""
Service-layer business logic for the ndpg application. Keeping this code outside views makes reconciliation, import, and dashboard logic easier to test and maintain.

Professional note:
    This project follows a simple separation of concerns:
    models store data, forms validate input, views control request/response flow,
    and services contain business rules such as import, reconciliation, dashboard
    summaries, dispute creation, and Excel generation.
